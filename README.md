## Training Recommendations

To achieve optimal network performance, consider the following:
1. **Data Augmentation**: Use techniques such as rotation, flipping, and contrast adjustment to improve generalization.
2. **Preprocessing**: Simplify input data where possible (e.g., grayscale conversion, resolution reduction).
3. **Label Simplification**: For tasks like segmentation, minimize output complexity by predicting key points or simplified outputs.

## FPGA Deployment Tips

When designing FPGA-specific networks:
1. Avoid complex architectures with skip connections like in Yolo or V-Net.
2. Prefer convolutions over dense layers for generalized feature extraction.
3. Utilize straightforward parallel data flow for efficient implementation.
4. Use layer configurations like `1x1`, `3x3`, or `1xN` convolutions for optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage.
